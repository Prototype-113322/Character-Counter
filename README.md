ðŸš€ Dynamic Theme Switching with CSS & JavaScript! ðŸŽ¨

Just wrapped up a responsive theme switcher that brings seamless transitions between light and dark modes. ðŸŒ—

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… Smooth theme transitions using CSS animations
âœ… Custom properties (CSS variables) for easy theme management
âœ… Clamp() for responsive typography across devices
âœ… Efficient JavaScript toggle with real-time UI updates

This project was a great way to enhance accessibility and user experience. If you're working on theme switching, I'd love to hear your thoughts!
